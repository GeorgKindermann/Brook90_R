### Manual
This manual includes the description of how to use BROOK90 in R.

#### 1. Documentation Files
These files are available for download and usage:

  * Manual.Rmd - instruction how to make the model work
  * Rmd-Files - as a documentation (on Github) of the created scripts to help the understanding
  * html-Files - to download the documentation and read on an own computer
  * Data and R Code - necessary data (precipitation data, meteorological data, catchment parameters) and written R scripts to run the programm
  * Catchment parameters - five .txt files where the characteristics of the catchment can be changed
  * Plot output - example plot of calculated values
  
#### 2. Download the data
As the second step the files have to be downloaded and unpacked.

#### 3. Run the Programm
To run the programm in R, the MainProg.R script has to be opened. Necessary changes that have to be done are:

* change the SCRIPTPATH, where the scripts are located on your computer
* put the data (.txt files) and R-Codes in the same folder
* change the names of your input data (meteoFile, precFile), if you are not using the example
* change SCRIPTPATH_catchment, where the data of catchment parameters are located
* change catchment parameters in these files if necessary:
    + canopy.txt
    + fixed.txt
    + flow_standart.txt
    + initial.txt
    + location.txt

After all changes are done, MainProg.R can be started by "Run from source". The next step is to open the script B90V4.R. At the end of this script there is a code to plot the output data. In this case precipitation, evaporation, calculated and measured flow are plotted. If other data should be shown, add or exchange the output data with "timeseries_" in its name. Finally B90V4.R can also be started with "Run from source" and then the model is running.
